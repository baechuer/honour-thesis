description: Report task status for an AAIF chapter or online series — which event tasks are overdue or due soon, grouped by owner, read from the Event Tracker.docx — plus read-only Luma registration stats (going/waitlist/checked-in counts) for pushed events. Use when asked for the status / health / what's-due / RSVP numbers of a chapter or series' events.

# AAIF Event Status

> **Tooling rule — `gws` + Python only.** Every read, edit, and write of a Drive
> file goes through the `gws` CLI, driven from Python. **Prefer native Google
> formats**: edit `application/vnd.google-apps.*` files with the Docs/Sheets/
> Slides API. Drop to byte-level OOXML surgery on the `.docx`/`.pptx`/`.xlsx`
> zip parts (embedded fonts and untouched parts survive) only when the file
> genuinely is a stored Office file. **Never use LibreOffice / `soffice`** — not to edit, not to convert,
> and not to render a "just checking it locally" preview: it substitutes local
> system fonts for the brand fonts and drops OOXML it doesn't understand, so its
> output and its renders both misrepresent the real file. Same for `unoconv` and
> any desktop office suite. To *see* a file, render it through the API instead —
> a slide via `aaif_events.slides_export.render_slide_png`, a doc via
> `gws drive files copy` to a Google Doc → `gws drive files export` to PDF →
> trash the copy. Never round-trip a native Doc through `.docx` — it strips
> native features like Tabs.

Read-only digest of a chapter or online series' `Event Tracker.docx`: for each event,
the **overdue** and **due-soon** (within 7 days) tasks, grouped by owner.

**You (the agent) drive Google Drive via the `gws` CLI; the Python script only does the
deterministic parsing of a local file.** Prereq: `gws` installed and authenticated
(`gws-cli-access`).

## Steps

1. **Locate the tracker.** A chapter lives under the **Chapters** folder
   (`1IQ1K7aVOKUUkxAcfLuNjdETEnmavvtjx`); an online series under **Online**
   (`1g2vHrqDHfh9wBkDJryJIl8wqXA4J-d4i`). Find the folder, then its `Event Tracker.docx`:

   ```
   gws drive files list --params '{"q":"name = '\''<NAME>'\'' and '\''1IQ1K7aVOKUUkxAcfLuNjdETEnmavvtjx'\'' in parents and trashed=false","fields":"files(id,name)"}'
   # then, with the folder id:
   gws drive files list --params '{"q":"'\''<FOLDER_ID>'\'' in parents and name = '\''Event Tracker.docx'\'' and trashed=false","fields":"files(id)"}'
   ```
   If not found under Chapters, try the Online parent. (Mode is implicit: whichever
   folder it lived in.)

2. **Download it** into a temp dir:

   ```
   WORK=$(mktemp -d)
   gws drive files get --params '{"fileId":"<DOC_ID>","alt":"media"}' --output $WORK/tracker.docx
   ```
   The tracker holds organizer, speaker, and venue details — keep it in the temp
   dir and **never commit it** to the repo.

3. **Run the digest** (read-only, local):

   ```
   python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/event_status.py $WORK/tracker.docx ["event"]
   ```

Status is computed against today from each task's DUE cell; clock-time day-of tasks and
`Done` tasks are excluded. Nothing is written back — this skill only reads.

## Luma registration stats (read-only)

For events whose tracker LUMA URL holds their event page (written by
`aaif-create-event`'s Luma push), pull the live guest counts — going, pending,
waitlist, invited, declined, checked-in — plus registration state:

```
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/luma_stats.py $WORK/tracker.docx ["event"]
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/luma_stats.py --url https://luma.com/EVENT_SLUG
```

The script detects whether Luma is connected (that calendar's API key in
`LUMA_API_KEY` or keychain item `luma-api-key`; see `aaif-create-event` for
setup); when it isn't, it skips the stats with a note — the task digest above
still works, and the user can read the numbers off the event page manually.
This is strictly read-only —
it never writes to Luma, the tracker, or any sheet, and Luma data is never fed
back into the Intake Ops sheet. Use the numbers for the day-of slides
(`aaif-dayof-slides`) and the recap post (`aaif-recap-post`).

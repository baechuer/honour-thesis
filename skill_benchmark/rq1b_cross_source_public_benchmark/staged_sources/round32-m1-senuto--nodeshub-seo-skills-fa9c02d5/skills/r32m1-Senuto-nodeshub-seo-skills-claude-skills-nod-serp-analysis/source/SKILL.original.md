# SERP Analysis

You analyze Google search results using NodesHub SERPdata API to provide actionable SEO intelligence.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Single keyword analysis
python3 .claude/skills/nod-nodeshub-api/scripts/serpdata.py "keyword" --gl us --hl en

# Raw JSON for deeper analysis
python3 .claude/skills/nod-nodeshub-api/scripts/serpdata.py "keyword" --gl us --hl en --raw
```

**Cost:** 1 token per keyword. Check balance: `python3 .claude/skills/nod-nodeshub-api/scripts/balance.py`

## Setup

Requires `NODESHUB_API_KEY` in environment. Run:
```bash
python3 .claude/skills/nod-nodeshub-api/scripts/check_setup.py
```
If missing, see [nod-nodeshub-api setup](../nod-nodeshub-api/setup/README.md).

**If NodesHub is not set up:** Walk the user through the full process: (1) Get API key from [nodeshub.io](https://nodeshub.io) (API Playground). (2) Save to `.claude/settings.local.json` under `env.NODESHUB_API_KEY`, or run `python3 .claude/skills/nod-nodeshub-api/scripts/save_key.py YOUR_KEY`. (3) Point to [nod-nodeshub-api setup](../nod-nodeshub-api/setup/README.md) for details. (4) Have them run `check_setup.py` again to verify.

## Workflow: Single Keyword SERP Analysis

1. **Fetch SERP data** — run `serpdata.py` with `--raw` flag
2. **Analyze organic results** — who ranks, what content types dominate
3. **Map SERP features** — which features appear, what they reveal about intent
4. **Assess competition** — domain authority signals, content depth
5. **Identify opportunities** — gaps in existing results, underserved angles
6. **Deliver report** — structured analysis with actionable recommendations

## Workflow: Multi-Keyword SERP Comparison

1. **Fetch SERP for each keyword** (batch — mind token budget)
2. **Cross-reference domains** — who ranks across multiple keywords
3. **Compare SERP features** — how feature presence varies by keyword
4. **Identify keyword clusters** — keywords with overlapping SERPs = same intent
5. **Prioritize targets** — rank keywords by opportunity score

## Analysis Framework

### Organic Results Analysis

For each result in top 10, extract:
- **Domain** — who's ranking (brand vs. niche vs. aggregator)
- **Title patterns** — what title structures Google prefers
- **URL structure** — subfolder vs. subdomain, URL depth
- **Content type** — blog, product page, listicle, guide, tool, forum

### SERP Features Mapping

| Feature | What it reveals |
|---------|----------------|
| **People Also Ask** | Related questions users have — content expansion opportunities |
| **AI Overview** | Google's AI summary — what content gets cited |
| **Knowledge Panel** | Entity recognition — brand/topic authority signals |
| **Local Pack** | Local intent — needs local SEO strategy |
| **Videos** | Video intent — YouTube/video content opportunity |
| **Top Stories** | News intent — freshness matters |
| **Related Searches** | Semantic connections — keyword expansion ideas |
| **Featured Snippet** | Direct answer opportunity — structure content for position 0 |

### Intent Classification (from SERP signals)

Classify based on what you see:
- **Informational** — PAA, Knowledge Panel, long-form content dominate
- **Commercial** — Product comparisons, reviews, "best X" in titles
- **Transactional** — Shopping results, product pages, pricing in titles
- **Navigational** — Brand dominates, official site in #1

### Competition Assessment

Rate difficulty based on:
- **Domain types** — all big brands = hard; niche sites ranking = opportunity
- **Content quality** — thin results = easy to outrank; deep guides = harder
- **SERP volatility** — many SERP features = more entry points
- **Content freshness** — old dates = opportunity for fresh content

## Output Format

```markdown
## SERP Analysis: [keyword]

**Settings:** gl=[country], hl=[language], device=[device]
**Total results:** [count]

### Dominant Intent
[informational/commercial/transactional/navigational] — [evidence]

### SERP Features Present
- [Feature]: [insight]

### Top 10 Organic Results
| # | Domain | Title | Type | Notes |
|---|--------|-------|------|-------|
| 1 | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Domain Distribution
- [domain.com]: positions [X, Y] — [pattern]

### Content Patterns
- Dominant format: [listicle/guide/tool/...]
- Average title length: [X chars]
- Title patterns: [common structures]

### Opportunities
1. [Gap or angle not covered by current results]
2. [SERP feature not being targeted]
3. [Content type missing from results]

### Recommendations
1. [Specific, actionable recommendation]
2. [...]
```

## Parameters Reference

| Param | Values | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `--gl` | us, pl, de, uk, fr, es... | Country — affects local results |
| `--hl` | en, pl, de, fr, es... | Language — affects interface/results language |
| `--device` | desktop, mobile | Different SERP layouts and features |

For full country/language list: `python3 .claude/skills/nod-nodeshub-api/scripts/params.py countries`

## Tips

- **Always use `--raw`** for full analysis — the pretty output is just a preview
- **Compare desktop vs mobile** — SERP features differ significantly
- **Check different countries** — local competition varies
- **Mind token budget** — each call = 1 token. For 20 keywords = 20 tokens
- **Parse `snippets_data`** carefully — SERP features are the richest insight source

## Report

After collecting data, ask the user:

> "Add results to an HTML report?"
> 1. **New report** — creates a branded HTML report in `reports/`
> 2. **Existing report** — appends a section to a chosen report
> 3. **Skip** — no report

To generate, use the `render_report_section(data)` function from this skill's script,
then `create_report()` or `append_section()` from `report.py`:
```python
from report import create_report, append_section
section_html = render_report_section(analysis_data)
# New report:
path = create_report("SERP Analysis", sections=[section_html])
# Or append to existing:
path = append_section("reports/existing.html", section_html)
```

**Consolidation (keep under 50 lines):**
Before adding a new entry, check file length. If over 50 lines:
1. Merge duplicate/overlapping entries into single proven patterns
2. Remove entries older than 3 months that haven't been reinforced
3. Drop one-off observations that never recurred
4. Move detailed context to `LEARNED-archive.md` if worth preserving
5. Keep only entries that would change behavior - if obvious, cut it

# Content Brief

You generate comprehensive, data-driven content briefs by combining NodesHub SERPdata (competitor analysis), Query Fan-out (keyword expansion), and **Jina Reader** (competitor content crawling) APIs.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Generate research data for a brief
python3 .claude/skills/nod-content-brief/scripts/research.py "target keyword" --gl us --hl en

# With reasoning mode for deeper keyword expansion
python3 .claude/skills/nod-content-brief/scripts/research.py "target keyword" --gl us --hl en --mode reasoning
```

**Cost:** ~8.5 tokens (standard) or ~31 tokens (reasoning) per brief = 1 SERPdata + 1 Fan-out.

## Setup

Requires `NODESHUB_API_KEY`. Optional: `JINA_API_KEY` for competitor content crawling.

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/nod-nodeshub-api/scripts/check_setup.py
```

**If NodesHub is not set up:** Walk the user through the full process: (1) Get API key from [nodeshub.io](https://nodeshub.io) (API Playground). (2) Save to `.claude/settings.local.json` under `env.NODESHUB_API_KEY`, or run `python3 .claude/skills/nod-nodeshub-api/scripts/save_key.py YOUR_KEY`. (3) Point to [nod-nodeshub-api setup](../nod-nodeshub-api/setup/README.md) for details. (4) Have them run `check_setup.py` again to verify.

### Jina Reader (competitor crawling)

Jina Reader fetches competitor page content as clean markdown. Used to analyze what top-ranking pages actually contain.

```bash
# API: https://r.jina.ai/{URL}
# Key stored in .claude/settings.local.json under env.JINA_API_KEY
# Free tier: 20 RPM without key, 200 RPM with key (10M free tokens)
```

**Graceful degradation:** If Jina is unavailable, brief generation still works — just without competitor content analysis.

## Workflow: Generate Content Brief

1. **Clarify target** — keyword, target audience, content goal
2. **Run research script** — fetches SERP + keyword expansion in one call
3. **Crawl competitor content** — use Jina Reader to fetch top 3-5 competitor pages as markdown
4. **Analyze SERP competition** — what ranks, what content types, what's missing
5. **Map keyword opportunities** — related queries, questions, long-tail
6. **Determine intent** — match content format to dominant search intent
7. **Generate brief** — structured brief using output template
8. **Present to user** — with clear recommendations and alternatives

### Crawling competitors with Jina Reader

After getting SERP results, crawl top competitor URLs to analyze their actual content:

```bash
# Jina Reader API — URL to clean markdown
curl "https://r.jina.ai/{COMPETITOR_URL}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JINA_API_KEY" \
  -H "X-Return-Format: markdown"
```

Use the crawled content to:
- Identify what topics competitors cover (content gaps)
- Extract heading structures (H2/H3 patterns)
- Estimate word counts and content depth
- Find unique angles competitors miss

## Research Script Output

The `research.py` script returns combined data:

```json
{
  "keyword": "...",
  "serp": {
    "organic_results": [...],
    "serp_features": [...],
    "dominant_intent": "...",
    "domains": [...]
  },
  "fanout": {
    "related_queries": [...],
    "questions": [...],
    "topic_leaders": [...]
  },
  "tokens_used": 8.5
}
```

## Brief Components

### 1. Target Keyword & Intent

- Primary keyword and intent classification
- Secondary keywords (from Fan-out)
- Questions to answer (from Fan-out + PAA)

### 2. SERP Landscape

- Who ranks and what content type dominates
- SERP features present (opportunities)
- Content gaps in current results

### 3. Suggested Structure

Based on top-ranking content patterns:

| Dominant Type | Suggested Structure |
|---------------|-------------------|
| How-to guides | Step-by-step with H2 per step |
| Listicles | Numbered items with H2 per item |
| In-depth guides | Topical sections with H2/H3 hierarchy |
| Comparisons | Feature-by-feature with tables |
| Product pages | Benefits → Features → Social proof → CTA |

### 4. Heading Suggestions

Derive from:
- Top-ranking titles → H1 inspiration
- PAA questions → H2 candidates
- Fan-out queries → H2/H3 subtopics
- Related searches → additional sections

### 5. Content Requirements

- Estimated word count (based on competitor average)
- Must-cover topics (present in all top results)
- Differentiation angle (gap in current results)
- Internal linking opportunities

## Token Budget

| Brief Type | Mode | Tokens | Use Case |
|------------|------|--------|----------|
| Quick brief | standard | 8.5 | Blog posts, quick content |
| Deep brief | reasoning | 31 | Pillar content, high-value pages |
| Batch (5 briefs) | standard | 42.5 | Content calendar planning |

## Tips

- **Always check balance first** — briefs use both APIs
- **Standard mode is usually enough** — save reasoning for pillar content
- **Combine with nod-keyword-research** for editorial calendar context
- **Use the competitor gaps** as your primary differentiation angle
- **PAA questions make great H2s** — Google literally tells you what users want

## Branding

When outputting briefs as HTML, use branding from `assets/branding/brand-config.json` (company logo, colors, fonts). Import `from branding import load_brand, render_header, render_footer, brand_css`. Falls back to defaults if not configured. See `assets/branding/README.md`.

## Report

After collecting data, ask the user:

> "Add results to an HTML report?"
> 1. **New report** — creates a branded HTML report in `reports/`
> 2. **Existing report** — appends a section to a chosen report
> 3. **Skip** — no report

Use `render_report_section(result_data)` from `research.py`, then `create_report()` or `append_section()` from `report.py`.

**Consolidation (keep under 50 lines):**
Before adding a new entry, check file length. If over 50 lines:
1. Merge duplicate/overlapping entries into single proven patterns
2. Remove entries older than 3 months that haven't been reinforced
3. Drop one-off observations that never recurred
4. Move detailed context to `LEARNED-archive.md` if worth preserving
5. Keep only entries that would change behavior - if obvious, cut it

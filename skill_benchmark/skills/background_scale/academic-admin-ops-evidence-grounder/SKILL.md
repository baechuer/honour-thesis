# Academic Admin Ops Evidence Grounder

Background scale skill used to create realistic retrieval pressure in the benchmark.

## Dependency Profile

academic administration operations procedure over course policy, enrollment note, assessment record, student request; requires preserving the procedure-specific input state and output artifact.

## External Dependencies To Preserve

- institution policy
- student record
- assessment criteria
- deadline
- task-specific constraints

## Resource And Structure Signals

- course
- student
- assessment
- policy
- enrollment
- evidence grounder

## Use when

- The user wants claims checked against course policy, enrollment note, assessment record, student request rather than rewritten or summarized.
- Source material is available and claims can be linked to evidence spans.
- The task needs this specific procedure rather than a neighboring confusable skill.
- The output should match the expected artifact below.

## Not for

- Replacing a gold-label core benchmark skill when that core skill is procedurally more specific.
- Broad internal routing across unrelated domains.
- Acting on missing context without asking for or identifying the needed input.

## Workflow

1. Identify the user's intended input and desired artifact.
2. Confirm this skill's procedure is the best fit rather than a neighboring skill.
3. Extract the relevant constraints, evidence, or requirements.
4. Produce the expected output in a compact and reusable form.
5. State uncertainty or required follow-up when the input is incomplete.

## Expected output

Claim-evidence map with supported, unsupported, and uncertain claims.

## Writing rules

- Keep the result focused on this skill's procedural role.
- Do not silently switch to a more specific benchmark core skill.
- Preserve important caveats and source limits.

name: Rubric Builder
description: Builds grading rubrics - analytic, holistic, or single-point - with criteria traced to learning objectives, 3-5 performance levels, observable behavior in every cell, and defensible weighting. Use when someone asks "make a rubric for this essay", "how should I grade this project", "turn these objectives into scoring criteria", or "my rubric feels vague, fix it". Do NOT use for writing the quiz questions themselves - use quiz-generator instead; for rubrics that score job candidates in interviews, use screening-rubric-builder; for narrative comments on a specific student's work, use student-feedback-writer.

# Rubric Builder

A rubric does two jobs: it tells students exactly what mastery looks like before they begin, and it gives teachers a consistent, defensible standard when scoring. The costly failure this skill prevents is the adjective ladder - "excellent / good / fair / poor" - which students cannot act on before submitting and teachers cannot defend when a grade is challenged.

## Operating procedure

### Step 1: Gather inputs

1. The assignment or task being assessed (required - the actual prompt, not a summary).
2. The learning objectives it assesses (required; if the user has none written, draft them first and label them as guesses for confirmation).
3. Grade or level, and the stakes (minor credit vs major grade - this drives format).
4. Point total, if the gradebook requires one (default: 100).
5. Whether a student-facing version is needed (default: offer one).

### Step 2: Derive criteria from objectives

List the objectives, then derive one criterion per objective or per cluster of tightly related objectives. Trace test: if a criterion cannot be traced to a stated objective, cut it. Practical ceiling: 3-6 criteria; beyond 6, scoring time balloons and criteria start overlapping. Mechanics/conventions may earn one criterion at most, and only if the objectives include communication quality.

### Step 3: Choose the format

- Analytic (each criterion scored separately): default for any graded assignment worth more than minor credit; the only format that produces diagnostic feedback per criterion.
- Holistic (single overall score): quick checks and short, low-stakes tasks only.
- Single-point (describes proficient only, with narrative space either side): efficient for iterative draft work where the goal is revision, not a grade.

### Step 4: Set the performance levels

3-5 levels; four is the standard: Exceeds Expectations, Meets Expectations, Approaching Expectations, Does Not Yet Meet Expectations. Three levels work for simple tasks. Five is the ceiling - more levels create scoring drift between graders and are rarely worth the calibration effort. Label levels with descriptive language, not just numbers, so feedback is inherent in the score.

### Step 5: Write descriptors - proficient first, observable only

Write the Meets Expectations cell first for each criterion, then adjust up and down. Every cell must describe observable features of the work - what it contains, how it is structured, what is missing - never grader impressions. Banned words in cells: excellent, good, poor, adequate, some, few, needs improvement, appropriate. Cell test: could two graders who have never met apply this cell to the same paper and land on the same level? Adjacent levels must differ by a nameable feature, not an adverb ("cites two or more sources" vs "cites one source", not "cites well" vs "cites adequately").

### Step 6: Weight the criteria

Assign points or percentages reflecting each criterion's importance to the objectives - the central skill should carry the most weight (typically 30-40% of total), mechanics rarely more than 10-15%. Document the weighting rationale in one sentence so it can be shared with students and defended to stakeholders.

### Step 7: Calibrate before use

Score one strong, one middling, and one weak sample (real or imagined) against the rubric. Any cell that forced a judgment call gets rewritten before the rubric ships.

## Skeleton: analytic rubric

Copy and replace the [FILL] fields.

```
RUBRIC - [FILL: assignment] - [FILL: total points]
Assesses objectives: [FILL: list]
Weighting rationale: [FILL: one sentence]

| Criterion (weight)        | Exceeds (pts)          | Meets (pts)            | Approaching (pts)      | Not Yet (pts)          |
| [FILL: criterion 1] ([FILL]%) | [FILL: observable features beyond proficient] | [FILL: observable features of proficiency - write this cell FIRST] | [FILL: named gap vs Meets] | [FILL: what is absent] |
| [FILL: criterion 2] ([FILL]%) | [FILL]             | [FILL]                 | [FILL]                 | [FILL]                 |
| [FILL: criterion 3] ([FILL]%) | [FILL]             | [FILL]                 | [FILL]                 | [FILL]                 |
| TOTAL                     |                        |                        |                        | [FILL] pts             |
```

Example of a filled cell pair (essay, criterion "Use of evidence", Meets vs Approaching):
- Meets: "Every body paragraph includes at least one quoted or paraphrased source, cited, and followed by a sentence explaining how it supports the claim."
- Approaching: "Most body paragraphs include a source, but at least one quotation is dropped in without an explanation connecting it to the claim."

## Deliverable

Produce the rubric as a table - rows are criteria, columns are performance levels - with point values per cell, a total-points row, a header naming the assignment and the objectives assessed, and the one-sentence weighting rationale. Offer a student-facing plain-language version.

## Do NOT

- Do not write adjective ladders; "excellent vs good" ranks work without describing it, so students cannot self-assess and grades cannot be defended.
- Do not include a criterion untraceable to an objective; it grades something never taught.
- Do not exceed five levels; fine gradations feel rigorous but produce inter-grader drift.
- Do not let mechanics outweigh the target skill; a brilliant argument with comma errors should not score below a vacuous clean one.
- Do not use holistic format for major grades; a single number gives the student nothing to fix.

## Quality bar

- Every criterion traces to a stated objective; 3-6 criteria total.
- Every cell passes the two-grader test and names observable features.
- Adjacent levels differ by a nameable feature, not an adverb.
- Weights sum correctly and the heaviest weight sits on the central skill.
- The rubric was calibrated against at least three sample performances.

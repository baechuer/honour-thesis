# Dead Code Eliminator

Delete code only after converging evidence proves it dead, then remove it in reversible slices that include its tests, fixtures, config, and flags.

## Workflow

1. **Scope one cluster.** Pick a single symbol, file, or feature to prove dead. Do not batch unrelated removals - a regression must point to one change.
2. **Gather static evidence.** Run the language's dead-code detector (ts-prune or knip for TS/JS, vulture for Python, `deadcode` for Go) and a dependency grapher (madge) or IDE "find usages". Record what each reports unreachable.
3. **Gather runtime evidence.** Check production coverage or profiling data over a representative window - at least 30 days for user-facing paths, 90+ days for code tied to monthly or quarterly jobs - and telemetry: was this endpoint, job, or branch hit this quarter? A symbol is a deletion candidate only when static analysis AND runtime evidence agree. One signal alone produces false positives that take down prod.
4. **Hunt the dynamic callers static tools miss.** Grep the symbol name as a *string* (reflection, string-keyed dispatch, serialization). Check DI containers, registries, ORM hooks, cron/queue workers, and feature-flag config. Search infra repos and other services. Public API surface and library exports are reachable by definition unless you control every consumer.
5. **Classify the kind of dead, because each is removed differently.** Unreachable (no path calls it) → delete. Unused (callable, never called) → delete. Redundant (duplicates a live path) → repoint callers first. Dormant-behind-a-flag (flag off for a cycle) → retire the flag first, then delete its branch.
6. **Soft-delete risky removals first.** Replace the suspect path with log-and-throw, or gate it behind a kill flag while keeping the code, for one full business cycle - 30 days minimum, 90 for anything touching monthly or quarterly processes. If nothing fires the log, proceed. For low-risk leaf code, skip to step 7.
7. **Delete in a focused PR.** Remove the code AND its tests, fixtures, config, flags, and now-orphaned imports. Keep the diff under roughly 400 changed lines so it is reviewable in one sitting; a bigger cluster gets split into multiple PRs. Let CI and the type-checker catch references the search missed. No formatting or refactors in the same diff.

## Deliverable

Produce a deletion PR (one per cluster) containing the removed code plus its entire footprint - tests, fixtures, config, flags, orphaned imports - and a PR description that cites the two converging evidence signals, names which of the four kinds of dead the code is, and, for soft-deleted paths, records the observation window with zero hits.

## Quality bar

- Every deletion cites at least two independent converging signals (static + runtime).
- The PR removes the dead symbol's entire footprint, leaving no orphaned test, fixture, or flag.
- The removal names which of the four kinds of dead it is.
- Reverting the PR cleanly restores the prior behavior.

## Do NOT

- Treat "I can't find a caller" as proof of death - absence of a static caller is not absence of a dynamic one.
- Delete code you only suspect is dead, public API without consumer proof, or code added in the last few weeks (it may be ahead of its caller).
- Skip the string-grep and DI/flag/registry check for anything invoked indirectly.
- Fold formatting or refactors into a deletion PR.
- Batch many clusters into one PR.

When evidence is ambiguous, mark the symbol deprecated and instrument it rather than guessing.

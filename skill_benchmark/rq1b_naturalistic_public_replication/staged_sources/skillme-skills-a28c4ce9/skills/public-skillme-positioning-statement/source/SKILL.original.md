# Positioning Statement

Positioning is the context you set so a buyer instantly understands what you are,
why you are different, and why they should care. Get it wrong and every downstream
asset - the headline, the deck, the launch - is fluent nonsense written about the
wrong product for the wrong person. This is the first GTM step. Everything else
([[messaging-hierarchy]], [[launch-plan-sequencer]], [[launch-day-runbook]],
[[plg-motion-designer]], [[sales-enablement-kit]]) is calibrated to its output, so do
it first and do it honestly.

The trap is positioning from ambition - the category you wish you led, the buyer
you wish you had. Position from evidence instead: the alternatives real customers
weigh, the attributes you actually have, and the segment that already loves you.
This follows April Dunford's method (*Obviously Awesome*): build positioning bottom-up
from competitive alternatives, not top-down from a category you picked.

## When to use this skill

Reach for it before writing any customer-facing copy or planning a launch, and
re-run it whenever the product, the best-fit customer, or the competitive set has
moved. If a founder says "we sound generic," "nobody gets what we do," or "what
category are we even in," that is a positioning problem, not a copy problem - start here.

## The workflow - five components, in this order

Run them in sequence; each later component is derived from the earlier ones. Do NOT
jump to the market frame first - the category you can credibly claim is an *output*
of the value you deliver, not an input you assert.

1. **Competitive alternatives.** List what a customer would *actually* do if you
   did not exist - and be honest: the real alternative is usually a spreadsheet,
   a manual process, a hire, or "do nothing," not the funded competitor you fear.
   These alternatives define the frame the buyer is already in. (For deep rival
   teardowns, defer to the catalog's `competitive-intelligence` skill - here you
   only need the alternatives a buyer weighs at the point of decision.)
2. **Unique attributes.** List the features, capabilities, assets, or facts you
   have that the alternatives do not. Attributes are objective and provable -
   "reconciles in real time," "ships with 40 connectors," "SOC 2 from day one" -
   not adjectives like "powerful" or "intuitive." If an alternative can claim it
   too, it is not unique; cut it.
3. **Value (the so-what).** Translate each unique attribute into the value it
   *enables* for the customer. Attribute → value: "reconciles in real time" →
   "closes the books in a day instead of a week." Buyers do not buy attributes;
   they buy the outcome the attribute makes possible. Cluster the values into 2-3
   themes - these become the spine of [[messaging-hierarchy]].
4. **Best-fit customer segment.** Identify who cares about that value *the most* -
   the segment for whom your unique value is urgent, not nice-to-have. Describe them
   by characteristics you can target (role, company stage, trigger event), not a
   vague persona. Narrow beats broad: the tightest segment that loves you gives the
   sharpest positioning. A weak best-fit segment is the #1 silent positioning killer.
5. **Market frame / category.** Choose the market context that makes your value
   obvious to that segment - the frame of reference that tells the buyer what to
   compare you against and what to expect. You can lead a known category, fight for
   a slice of one, or (rarely, expensively) create a new one. Pick the frame that
   makes your unique value the *obvious* choice; the wrong frame makes your
   strengths look irrelevant.

Deliberately out of scope here: price points and packaging tiers. Positioning sets
the frame; what to charge inside it is [[pricing-strategy]] / [[saas-pricing]]. Naming,
taglines, and page copy are downstream in [[messaging-hierarchy]].

## The one-paragraph statement

Assemble the five components into a single tight internal paragraph. This is an
*internal alignment artifact*, not customer copy - it is the brief every later
skill reads. Fill this template:

```
For [best-fit segment, described by targetable traits]
who [the trigger / situation that makes the value urgent],
[Product] is a [market frame / category]
that [the single most important value, the so-what].
Unlike [the dominant competitive alternative they'd otherwise choose],
[Product] [the unique attribute(s) that make that value possible].
```

Worked example (a fictional close-automation tool):

```
For Series-A-to-B SaaS controllers
who are closing the books manually in spreadsheets and missing board deadlines,
LedgerLoop is a continuous-close accounting platform
that lets finance close the month in a day instead of a week.
Unlike general ledgers and bolt-on close checklists,
LedgerLoop reconciles every transaction in real time as it lands,
so the books are always one day from done.
```

Note what the example does NOT do: no price, no "powerful/intuitive," no
"for everyone," no invented category nobody searches for. Every clause traces to one
of the five components.

## Runnable artifact - positioning scorer

A self-contained Node script that scores a candidate positioning statement against
the five components and the most common failure modes, so the founder gets a sharp,
repeatable check instead of a vibe. Save as `score-positioning.mjs` and run
`node score-positioning.mjs`.

```js
// score-positioning.mjs - score a positioning statement, Dunford-style.
// No deps. Edit the `p` object, then: node score-positioning.mjs

const p = {
  segment: "Series-A-to-B SaaS controllers",
  trigger: "closing the books manually in spreadsheets, missing board deadlines",
  category: "continuous-close accounting platform",
  value: "close the month in a day instead of a week",
  alternative: "general ledgers and bolt-on close checklists",
  attributes: ["reconciles every transaction in real time as it lands"],
};

// Words that signal you wrote an adjective instead of a provable attribute/value.
const FLUFF = ["powerful", "intuitive", "seamless", "robust", "innovative",
  "world-class", "best-in-class", "cutting-edge", "easy-to-use", "next-gen"];
const BROAD = ["everyone", "anyone", "all businesses", "any company", "teams of all sizes"];

const checks = [
  ["Has a best-fit segment", () => p.segment.trim().length > 0],
  ["Segment is targetable, not 'everyone'",
    () => !BROAD.some((b) => p.segment.toLowerCase().includes(b))],
  ["Has a trigger that makes value urgent", () => p.trigger.trim().length > 0],
  ["Names the real competitive alternative",
    () => p.alternative.trim().length > 0],
  ["Has >=1 unique, provable attribute", () => p.attributes.length >= 1],
  ["Value reads as an outcome (has 'instead of' or a metric/verb)",
    () => /(instead of|in (a|one) |without |so |faster|less|days?|hours?|week)/i.test(p.value)],
  ["No adjective fluff in value/attributes",
    () => ![p.value, ...p.attributes].some((s) =>
      FLUFF.some((f) => s.toLowerCase().includes(f)))],
  ["Category is a frame, not a slogan",
    () => p.category.trim().split(/\s+/).length <= 5 && p.category.trim().length > 0],
];

let pass = 0;
console.log("\nPositioning scorecard\n---------------------");
for (const [label, fn] of checks) {
  const ok = fn();
  if (ok) pass++;
  console.log(`${ok ? "PASS" : "FAIL"}  ${label}`);
}
const pct = Math.round((pass / checks.length) * 100);
console.log(`\nScore: ${pass}/${checks.length} (${pct}%)`);
console.log(pct === 100
  ? "Tight. Hand it to messaging-hierarchy."
  : "Fix the FAILs before writing any copy.\n");
```

Expected output for the example above:

```
Positioning scorecard
---------------------
PASS  Has a best-fit segment
PASS  Segment is targetable, not 'everyone'
PASS  Has a trigger that makes value urgent
PASS  Names the real competitive alternative
PASS  Has >=1 unique, provable attribute
PASS  Value reads as an outcome (has 'instead of' or a metric/verb)
PASS  No adjective fluff in value/attributes
PASS  Category is a frame, not a slogan

Score: 8/8 (100%)
Tight. Hand it to messaging-hierarchy.
```

## Quality bar

The positioning is done when:

- Every clause in the paragraph traces back to one of the five components - no
  free-floating claims.
- The competitive alternative is the one a real buyer would *actually* pick, often
  "do nothing" or a spreadsheet - not the competitor that scares the founder.
- Each unique attribute is provable and exclusive: if an alternative could honestly
  claim it too, it is cut.
- Every attribute has a stated so-what value; no attribute is left as a feature.
- The best-fit segment is narrow enough to target and is described by a trigger,
  not a demographic mood.
- The market frame makes the unique value look *obvious*, and a stranger could
  guess what you compete with from the category alone.
- The whole statement survives being read aloud to a skeptic in under 20 seconds
  without a follow-up "wait, but what *is* it?"
- It contains zero price points and zero adjectives doing the work facts should do.

## Do NOT

- Do NOT write headlines, taglines, or page copy here. This produces the internal
  brief; the customer-facing words are [[messaging-hierarchy]]'s job.
- Do NOT set price, tiers, or packaging - defer to [[pricing-strategy]] /
  [[saas-pricing]]. Positioning is the frame, not the number.
- Do NOT invent a brand-new category to "own" unless you have the budget and proof
  to educate a market into it. Creating a category is the most expensive play in
  positioning; most products should lead or sub-segment an existing one.
- Do NOT position against the funded competitor when the real alternative is a
  spreadsheet or doing nothing. You will answer questions no buyer is asking.
- Do NOT pick the broadest possible segment to "keep options open." Broad
  positioning is invisible positioning; the tightest best-fit segment wins.
- Do NOT let adjectives ("powerful," "seamless," "intuitive") stand in for provable
  attributes. If you cannot demo it or cite it, it is not an attribute.
- Do NOT proceed to [[launch-plan-sequencer]], [[launch-day-runbook]], or
  [[sales-enablement-kit]] until the one-paragraph statement scores clean - a launch
  built on muddy positioning only amplifies the muddiness.

## Deliverable

A filled five-component worksheet (alternatives, unique attributes, value/so-what,
best-fit segment, market frame), the assembled one-paragraph positioning statement,
a passing positioning scorecard, and a one-line note on the single riskiest assumption
in the positioning to validate with customers. Hand the paragraph to
[[messaging-hierarchy]] to turn into copy, and to [[launch-plan-sequencer]] to plan the launch.

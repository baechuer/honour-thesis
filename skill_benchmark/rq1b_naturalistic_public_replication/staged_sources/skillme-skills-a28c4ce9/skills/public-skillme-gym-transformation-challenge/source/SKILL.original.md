description: Designs a gym's 6-week transformation challenge as a self-funding front-end offer and the week-by-week ascension that converts challengers into recurring members. Use when a gym owner asks to "design a 6-week challenge", structure a "transformation challenge", build a "front-end offer to fill my gym", plan a challenge "run-of-show", or figure out "how do I convert challengers to members". Do NOT use when the request is about the paid ads, audiences, or lead forms that fill the challenge - use gym-meta-ads-funnel instead.

# Gym Transformation Challenge

Structure a time-bound (usually 6-week) front-end challenge that fills the gym at low friction, breaks even on its own ad spend, and is engineered to ascend challengers into recurring membership.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Structure the challenge

Decide and write down each element:

- **Duration**: 6 weeks by default - long enough for a visible result, short enough to feel doable.
- **Promise**: one specific, believable result. "Drop a dress size in 6 weeks" beats "get fit."
- **Inclusions**: sessions per week, a done-for-you nutrition plan, weekly accountability check-ins, a start and finish body-composition scan, a private group. Each inclusion removes one obstacle the buyer would otherwise face.
- **Price**: common range 199 to 599. The price must cover ad spend and fulfillment, leaving the back-end membership as the profit. (If you also run gym-money-model, set the price there so the challenge clears the cash rule; otherwise size it directly with Step 4.)

### Step 2: Design the ascension to membership

The challenge is not the business; the membership is. Decide before launch how a challenger becomes a member.

- **The conversion offer**: a member price and terms presented at the end of the challenge. Make staying easier than stopping - a member rate available only to challengers and only this week.
- **The timing**: present it in week 5, after the mid-challenge win and before the final week, when motivation peaks. Book a results review for every challenger and run the conversion conversation there.
- **The bridge**: continuity of coach, group, and plan. Frame membership as keeping the result they just earned, not buying a new thing.

Fill the conversion-offer-sheet template for the exact offer presented to challengers.

### Step 3: Run the challenge week by week

- **Pre-launch (week 0)**: fill the cohort, collect payment, send the welcome, book the first scan, add each challenger to the private group.
- **Week 1**: onboarding, baseline scan, a first session designed to feel like a win, nutrition plan handed over, group introductions.
- **Weeks 2-4**: deliver sessions, run weekly check-ins, keep attendance high, post early results publicly in the group, seed the idea of continuing past the challenge.
- **Week 5**: per-challenger results review, present the membership conversion offer, book consults for the undecided. This is the conversion week.
- **Week 6**: final scan, transformation celebration, close remaining conversions, collect before-and-after proof and testimonials for the next cohort.

See references/challenge-blueprint for the full deliverables per week.

### Step 4: Confirm the economics

Run challenge_pnl.js with the cohort's numbers. It returns front-end profit or loss after ad spend and fulfillment, and projected back-end revenue from conversions. See references/challenge-economics.

### Step 5: Produce the artifacts

Fill challenge-offer-sheet (the public offer), conversion-offer-sheet (the end-of-challenge membership offer), and challenge-runbook (the internal week-by-week checklist with owners and timing).

## Quality bar

A challenge is ready to launch only when:

- The promise is one specific, measurable result with a deadline - not a vibe.
- The front-end nets at or above breakeven in challenge_pnl.js before a single membership converts. Growth must not depend on borrowing against future dues.
- A dated, challenger-only member rate exists in writing before the cohort starts.
- Every challenger has a booked week-5 results review, not an open invitation.
- The runbook names an owner and a date for every step.

## Do NOT

- Do NOT price the challenge to maximize front-end profit. It exists to acquire members at breakeven; the membership is the profit.
- Do NOT design the conversion offer after the challenge starts. If the member rate and deadline aren't set before launch, conversion improvises and collapses.
- Do NOT leave conversion to a group announcement. It happens in a one-to-one results review.
- Do NOT extend the challenge to "give people more time." The deadline is the conversion mechanism.
- Do NOT write the ad copy, audiences, or lead forms here - that is gym-meta-ads-funnel's job; this skill stops at the offer and run-of-show.

## Calculator

Self-contained Node script. Save as `challenge_pnl.js` and run with `node challenge_pnl.js`. No dependencies.

```javascript
// Challenge P&L and back-end projection. Edit inputs, then: node challenge_pnl.js
const inputs = {
  fillCount: 20,                 // paid challengers enrolled
  challengePrice: 499,           // price per challenger
  costPerLead: 25,               // ad cost per lead
  showRate: 0.4,                 // share of leads that become paid challengers
  fulfillmentPerChallenger: 120, // cost to deliver the challenge per person
  conversionToMembership: 0.5,   // share of challengers who become members
  membershipLtv: 1558,           // contribution LTV per member
}

function pnl(i) {
  const leadsNeeded = i.fillCount / i.showRate
  const adSpend = leadsNeeded * i.costPerLead
  const frontEndRevenue = i.fillCount * i.challengePrice
  const fulfillmentCost = i.fillCount * i.fulfillmentPerChallenger
  const frontEndProfit = frontEndRevenue - adSpend - fulfillmentCost
  const cacPerChallenger = adSpend / i.fillCount
  const newMembers = i.fillCount * i.conversionToMembership
  const cacPerMember = adSpend / newMembers
  const backEndRevenue = newMembers * i.membershipLtv
  const totalValue = frontEndProfit + backEndRevenue
  return {
    leadsNeeded, adSpend, frontEndRevenue, fulfillmentCost, frontEndProfit,
    cacPerChallenger, newMembers, cacPerMember, backEndRevenue, totalValue,
  }
}

const r = pnl(inputs)
const m = (n) => '$' + n.toFixed(0)
console.log('FRONT END')
console.log('  Leads needed:        ', Math.ceil(r.leadsNeeded))
console.log('  Ad spend:            ', m(r.adSpend))
console.log('  Challenge revenue:   ', m(r.frontEndRevenue))
console.log('  Fulfillment cost:    ', m(r.fulfillmentCost))
console.log('  Front-end profit:    ', m(r.frontEndProfit),
  r.frontEndProfit >= 0 ? '(self-funding)' : '(loss, back-end must cover)')
console.log('  CAC per challenger:  ', m(r.cacPerChallenger))
console.log('BACK END')
console.log('  New members:         ', r.newMembers)
console.log('  CAC per member:      ', m(r.cacPerMember))
console.log('  Projected LTV value: ', m(r.backEndRevenue))
console.log('TOTAL projected value: ', m(r.totalValue))
```

### Worked example output

```
FRONT END
  Leads needed:         50
  Ad spend:             $1250
  Challenge revenue:    $9980
  Fulfillment cost:     $2400
  Front-end profit:     $6330 (self-funding)
  CAC per challenger:   $63
BACK END
  New members:          10
  CAC per member:       $125
  Projected LTV value:  $15580
TOTAL projected value:  $21910
```

Read it: $1,250 of ads fills 20 challengers who pay $9,980. After ads and fulfillment the challenge nets $6,330 before a single membership sells, so it self-funds. Half convert, adding $15,580 in projected lifetime contribution. Drop the fill or conversion rate and watch where the model breaks.

## references/challenge-blueprint

Full 6-week run-of-show and deliverables:

- **Pre-launch (week 0)**: confirm payment, send a welcome that sets expectations, collect a starting photo and measurements, book the week-one scan, add each challenger to the private group.
- **Week 1**: baseline body scan, movement assessment, a first session designed to feel like a win, nutrition plan handed over, group introductions. Goal: an early result and the habit started.
- **Week 2**: first weekly check-in, address early friction (soreness, schedule), publicly celebrate the first small wins in the group.
- **Week 3**: progress check, adjust nutrition, keep attendance high. Reinforce that results are tracking.
- **Week 4**: mid-point scan or measurement, share visible progress, begin seeding the idea of continuing past the challenge.
- **Week 5**: results review per challenger, present the conversion offer, book a short consult for anyone undecided. This is the conversion week.
- **Week 6**: final scan, transformation celebration, close remaining conversions, collect before-and-after photos and testimonials for the next cohort's ads.

The conversion mechanic: every challenger gets a one-to-one results review where the coach shows the progress, names the result still available with continued training, and presents the challenger-only member rate with a deadline.

## references/challenge-economics

A challenge is self-funding when up-front challenge revenue covers ad spend and fulfillment, leaving the back-end membership as profit. The four levers are fill count, challenge price, cost per lead (which sets ad spend through the show rate), and conversion to membership. Tune them in challenge_pnl.js.

If the front-end runs at a loss (low price or high cost per lead), the back-end can still justify it - but only when conversion and LTV are strong and the gym has the cash to wait for dues. The safer design keeps the front-end at or above breakeven so growth never depends on borrowing against future revenue.

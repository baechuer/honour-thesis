description: Works like a Forward Deployed Engineer (FDE) embedded at a customer or inside an unfamiliar codebase. Use when the AI agent is asked to write code in someone else's repo, an existing or legacy project, an unknown stack, or a customer environment with its own conventions, branches, CI, and deployment gates. Covers the engagement arc: orient in the codebase before writing anything, extract the real requirement from non-technical stakeholders, build in-place matching the repo's existing patterns, respect the customer's SDLC gates, and hand over maintainable code. Also use when the user says "work in their environment", "this is the client's repo", "understand the codebase first", or asks the agent to integrate into an existing system.

# Forward Deployed Engineer

## Overview

The Forward Deployed Engineer (FDE) works **embedded at the customer** — in their repo, their stack, their infra, under their conventions. The agent is not the owner of the codebase; it is a professional contractor who must understand the environment, build in-place, and hand over work a real team can maintain.

The engagement arc:

```
EMBED → ORIENT → EXTRACT → BUILD IN-PLACE → HAND OVER
```

Unlike greenfield work (where the agent sets the defaults), FDE work inverts the rules: **the repo's conventions win, not your defaults.**

## When to Use

- The task is in an existing, legacy, or unfamiliar codebase — not something the user is building from scratch.
- The user says "this is the client's repo" or "work in their environment".
- The task is an integration into existing systems (auth, APIs, internal tools, legacy services).
- The repo has its own branch model, CI, review, and deployment process that must be respected.
- A non-technical stakeholder is describing the request and the real need is unclear.

**When NOT to use:** greenfield projects the user owns, throwaway experiments, or anything where the agent is the definitive owner of the code and its conventions. Run those directly or with `loop-orchestrator`.

## The Engagement Arc

### 1. EMBED — Know the Customer

Establish who and where before touching code:

- Who is the customer / stakeholder, and what outcome do they care about?
- What environment is the work happening in (repo, host, infra, access level)?
- What are the boundaries — what is the agent allowed to change vs. read-only?

**Exit condition:** a clear statement of the customer, the environment, and the boundaries.

### 2. ORIENT — Recon Before Code (the distinctive core)

Read-only exploration **before writing anything**. Do not assume the repo works like your defaults.

Explore, in order:
- Repo layout: folders, entry points, module boundaries.
- Language, runtime, and exact versions (read the dependency files, don't guess).
- Existing conventions: naming, error handling, folder structure, code style.
- CI setup: what checks run, what the branch/merge model is.
- Existing tests: how they run, what the test command is.
- Deploy process: how this repo ships, what the gates are.

Rules:
- Ground every stack fact in what you actually read. Use `source-driven-development` for anything you are not sure about — do not implement from memory of a framework you think resembles this one.
- If a decision matters and the code is unfamiliar, run `doubt-driven-development` before it stands.
- **No code until you can explain the repo's conventions back to the customer.** If you cannot, keep orienting.

**Exit condition (deterministic):** you can describe the repo's language/versions, conventions, test command, CI checks, and branch model from evidence.

### 3. EXTRACT — Find the Real Requirement

Discover what the customer actually needs. FDE extraction is conversational and in business language, not formal from the start.

- Ask short questions a non-technical stakeholder can answer. Restate the request in their words and confirm before building.
- Find the problem under the feature request: the requested feature is often one solution to a deeper problem. Ask what happens today, what breaks, and what "done" looks like to them.
- Capture what, why, expected behaviour, and edge cases.
- If the stakeholder is technical or the spec must be rigorous, run `requirements-analysis` or `feature-forge` for the formal output.

**Exit condition:** the requirement is restated in the customer's words, confirmed by them, and covers what/why/expected behaviour/edge cases.

### 4. BUILD IN-PLACE — Match Their Patterns, Not Yours

Implement inside the existing codebase, fitting its conventions:

- Follow the repo's existing patterns for naming, error handling, folder structure, and style — even where you would do it differently.
- Build in thin slices and keep the repo working between them (`incremental-implementation`).
- For cross-stack breadth (frontend + backend + security in one flow), run `fullstack-guardian`.
- Respect the customer's SDLC gates end to end: branch → commit → PR → review → CI → merge → staging → production. Run `sdlc-workflow` for the pipeline and its gate discipline.
- Comments explain *why* only — the customer's team will maintain this code.

**Exit condition (deterministic):** the change is implemented in the customer's style, passes their tests and build, and each slice met its acceptance criterion.

### 5. HAND OVER — Leave a Team-Ready Result

Deliver work a colleague can maintain:

- A short summary a non-technical stakeholder can read: what changed, what it does, how it was verified.
- For technical handover: what was changed, where, how to test, and what was deliberately left out.
- Update the changelog if the repo keeps one.
- Demo or describe the result in the customer's business language, not implementation jargon.

**Exit condition:** the customer can verify the change and a teammate can maintain it without asking the agent.

## FDE Decision Rules

1. **Orient before code.** No code until the repo's conventions are known from evidence.
2. **Their style wins.** Match the customer's patterns; do not introduce your defaults.
3. **Respect their gates.** Never bypass the repo's branch/PR/CI/deploy process, even to move faster.
4. **Reviewer ≠ builder.** Review and QA are separate passes; delegate to a sub-agent when possible.
5. **Escalate on repeated failure.** Two failed attempts in the same stage → stop and present the evidence, don't silently retry.
6. **Restate to confirm.** Never build on an unconfirmed guess about what the customer wants.

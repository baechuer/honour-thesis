## Instructions

### Phase 1 — Discovery and Goal Alignment

1. **Gather foundational context.** Ask the user (or extract from provided materials) the following critical inputs before proceeding:
   - The website URL, domain, or project name.
   - The primary business type (e-commerce, SaaS, local business, publisher, portfolio, marketplace, etc.).
   - The core business objectives tied to search (lead generation, revenue, brand awareness, information distribution, user acquisition).
   - The target audience: demographics, geographic focus, language, expertise level, and buying stage.
   - Existing SEO efforts already in place (if any), including tools currently used (Google Search Console, Google Analytics, Ahrefs, SEMrush, Screaming Frog, etc.).
   - Known pain points: declining traffic, poor rankings, thin content, technical issues, penalties, or competitive pressure.
   - Timeline expectations and resource constraints (in-house team, budget, content production capacity).

2. **Define measurable SEO objectives.** Translate business goals into specific, trackable SEO targets. Examples:
   - Increase organic traffic by X% within Y months.
   - Rank on page one for Z priority keywords.
   - Improve domain-wide crawl efficiency and indexation rate.
   - Reduce page load time to under specific Core Web Vitals thresholds.
   - Grow the number of ranking keywords in a target topic cluster.
   - Increase click-through rate from SERPs by optimizing metadata.

3. **Classify the engagement scope.** Determine whether the task requires:
   - A full-spectrum SEO strategy (proceed through all phases below).
   - A focused audit on a specific SEO dimension (skip to the relevant phase but still document findings in the structured output format).
   - A one-time optimization of specific pages or elements (proceed directly to the applicable optimization phase).

### Phase 2 — Keyword Research and Search Intent Mapping

4. **Identify seed topics.** Based on the business context gathered in Phase 1, generate a list of 10–30 seed topics that represent the core themes the website should be visible for. Derive these from:
   - The products, services, or information the business offers.
   - Problems the target audience is trying to solve.
   - Questions the audience asks at each stage of their journey (awareness, consideration, decision).
   - Industry terminology, synonyms, and colloquial variations.

5. **Expand into keyword candidates.** For each seed topic, generate keyword variations across these dimensions:
   - **Head terms** (1–2 words, high volume, high competition): e.g., "project management."
   - **Body keywords** (2–3 words, moderate volume): e.g., "project management software."
   - **Long-tail keywords** (4+ words, lower volume, higher intent specificity): e.g., "best project management software for remote teams."
   - **Question-based queries**: who, what, when, where, why, how queries related to the topic.
   - **Modifier-based queries**: best, top, vs, review, alternative, free, cheap, near me, for beginners, etc.
   - **Semantic and LSI variations**: related concepts, subtopics, and entity associations.

6. **Classify search intent for every keyword.** Assign one of four intent categories to each keyword:
   - **Informational**: The searcher wants to learn something. Signals: "how to," "what is," "guide," "tutorial."
   - **Navigational**: The searcher wants to reach a specific website or page. Signals: brand names, product names, "login," "pricing page."
   - **Commercial Investigation**: The searcher is evaluating options before a decision. Signals: "best," "vs," "review," "comparison," "top 10."
   - **Transactional**: The searcher wants to complete an action (buy, sign up, download). Signals: "buy," "discount," "coupon," "free trial," "pricing."

7. **Cluster keywords into topic groups.** Organize keywords into tightly themed clusters where:
   - Each cluster maps to a single pillar page or content hub.
   - Supporting keywords within the cluster map to individual subpages, blog posts, or FAQ entries.
   - The cluster structure mirrors the user's journey from broad awareness to specific action.
   - Output the clusters in a structured table format: Cluster Name | Primary Keyword | Secondary Keywords | Intent | Suggested Content Type | Priority (High/Medium/Low).

8. **Prioritize keywords using a scoring framework.** Evaluate each keyword or cluster against:
   - **Search volume**: Estimated monthly searches (use ranges if exact data is unavailable).
   - **Keyword difficulty / competition**: How hard it is to rank based on current SERP composition.
   - **Business relevance**: How directly the keyword relates to revenue-generating actions.
   - **Current ranking position**: Whether the site already ranks (positions 4–20 represent quick-win opportunities).
   - **Content gap opportunity**: Whether existing content addresses this keyword adequately.
   - Assign a composite priority score and rank clusters accordingly.

### Phase 3 — Competitor and SERP Analysis

9. **Identify SEO competitors.** Determine the top 5–10 domains that consistently rank for the priority keyword clusters identified in Phase 2. Distinguish between:
   - Direct business competitors (same products/services).
   - SERP competitors (different businesses but competing for the same keywords — e.g., media sites, aggregators, forums).

10. **Analyze competitor SEO profiles.** For each key competitor, evaluate:
    - **Domain authority / domain strength** indicators.
    - **Top-ranking pages**: Which URLs rank for the target keywords and what content format they use.
    - **Content depth and structure**: Word count ranges, heading structures, use of multimedia, content freshness.
    - **On-page optimization patterns**: Title tag formulas, meta description patterns, keyword placement strategies.
    - **Backlink profiles**: Approximate number of referring domains, types of linking sites, anchor text distribution.
    - **Technical advantages**: Page speed, mobile experience, structured data usage, site architecture.
    - **SERP feature ownership**: Which competitors appear in featured snippets, People Also Ask, knowledge panels, image packs, video carousels, or local packs.

11. **Identify competitive gaps and opportunities.** Document specific areas where the user's website can outperform competitors:
    - Topics competitors cover poorly or not at all.
    - Keywords where competitors rank with thin or outdated content.
    - SERP features not currently captured by any competitor.
    - Technical SEO weaknesses observed in competitor sites.
    - Content formats competitors are not using (video, interactive tools, data visualizations, templates).

---

### Phase 4 — Site Architecture and Internal Linking Optimization

12. **Audit the current site structure.** Map the existing website hierarchy:
    - Homepage → Category/Section pages → Subcategory pages → Individual content pages.
    - Identify the current click depth of important pages (how many clicks from the homepage).
    - Flag orphan pages (pages with no internal links pointing to them).
    - Flag pages with excessive depth (more than 3–4 clicks from homepage for important content).

13. **Design the optimal site architecture.** Based on the keyword clusters from Phase 2, recommend a site structure that:
    - Follows a flat hierarchy where critical pages are reachable within 2–3 clicks.
    - Groups content logically by topic cluster, with pillar pages serving as hub nodes.
    - Uses clear, descriptive, keyword-informed navigation labels.
    - Separates transactional pages (product, pricing, signup) from informational pages (blog, guides, resources) while maintaining internal links between them.
    - Includes a logical breadcrumb structure that reinforces topical hierarchy.

14. **Develop the internal linking strategy.** Provide specific internal linking recommendations:
    - Every cluster subpage should link back to its pillar page and to 2–3 sibling subpages within the same cluster.
    - Pillar pages should link to every subpage in their cluster.
    - Cross-cluster links should be used sparingly and only where topically relevant.
    - High-authority pages (pages with the most backlinks or traffic) should pass link equity to high-priority target pages via contextual internal links.
    - Specify anchor text recommendations: use descriptive, keyword-relevant anchor text; avoid generic anchors like "click here" or "read more."
    - Recommend the implementation of contextual in-content links over footer or sidebar links.

---

### Phase 5 — On-Page SEO Optimization

15. **Optimize title tags.** For each priority page, craft a title tag that:
    - Includes the primary keyword as close to the beginning as possible.
    - Stays within 50–60 characters to avoid truncation in SERPs.
    - Incorporates a compelling modifier or value proposition (e.g., year, "Complete Guide," a number, the brand name).
    - Is unique across the entire site — no duplicate titles.
    - Matches the dominant search intent for the target keyword.
    - Provide the exact recommended title tag text for each page.

16. **Optimize meta descriptions.** For each priority page, write a meta description that:
    - Is between 140–155 characters.
    - Includes the primary keyword naturally.
    - Contains a clear call-to-action or value statement that encourages clicks.
    - Differentiates the page from competing SERP results.
    - Is unique across the entire site.
    - Provide the exact recommended meta description text for each page.

17. **Optimize heading hierarchy (H1–H6).** Review and recommend:
    - Exactly one H1 per page, containing the primary keyword, accurately describing the page's main topic.
    - H2 subheadings that break content into logical sections, incorporating secondary keywords and related subtopics.
    - H3–H4 subheadings for detailed subsections where appropriate.
    - Headings should be scannable and informative — a user should understand the page's full scope by reading only the headings.
    - Provide the exact recommended heading structure as an outline.

18. **Optimize body content.** Evaluate and improve on-page content:
    - Ensure the primary keyword appears in the first 100 words of the body content.
    - Use secondary and semantic keywords naturally throughout the content without keyword stuffing (aim for natural language that a subject-matter expert would use).
    - Ensure content length is competitive with top-ranking pages for the same keyword (benchmark against the top 5 SERP results).
    - Structure content with short paragraphs (2–4 sentences), bullet points, numbered lists, tables, and visual breaks for readability.
    - Include original insights, data, examples, or perspectives that add unique value beyond what competitors offer.
    - Add a clear introductory paragraph that states what the reader will learn or gain.
    - Add a conclusion or summary section with a call-to-action where appropriate.
    - Ensure content satisfies the E-E-A-T framework: demonstrate Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness through author bios, citations, source links, and evidence-based claims.

19. **Optimize URL structures.** Recommend URL slugs that:
    - Are short, descriptive, and keyword-inclusive.
    - Use hyphens to separate words (no underscores, spaces, or special characters).
    - Avoid unnecessary parameters, session IDs, or dynamically generated strings.
    - Reflect the site hierarchy (e.g., `/topic-cluster/subtopic-page`).
    - Are lowercase and consistent.
    - Provide the exact recommended URL slug for each page.

20. **Optimize images and media.** For every image or media asset on priority pages:
    - Recommend descriptive, keyword-relevant file names (e.g., `seo-audit-checklist-template.png` instead of `IMG_4392.png`).
    - Write alt text that accurately describes the image content and incorporates relevant keywords naturally.
    - Recommend appropriate image formats (WebP for photographs, SVG for icons/logos, PNG for graphics requiring transparency).
    - Recommend implementing lazy loading for below-the-fold images.
    - Recommend responsive image attributes (`srcset`) for serving appropriately sized images based on viewport.
    - Specify maximum recommended file sizes (aim for under 100KB for standard images, under 200KB for hero images).

---

### Phase 6 — Technical SEO Audit and Optimization

21. **Crawlability and indexability assessment.** Evaluate and recommend fixes for:
    - **Robots.txt**: Ensure it is not blocking critical pages or resources; confirm it allows search engine crawlers access to CSS, JavaScript, and image files needed for rendering.
    - **XML Sitemap**: Confirm an XML sitemap exists, is submitted to Google Search Console, includes all indexable pages, excludes noindex pages, returns 200 status codes for all listed URLs, and is updated automatically when content changes.
    - **Noindex / Nofollow directives**: Audit pages with noindex or nofollow tags; confirm these are intentional and not accidentally blocking important content.
    - **Canonical tags**: Ensure every page has a self-referencing canonical tag; identify and resolve conflicting or incorrect canonical declarations; recommend canonical strategies for paginated content, parameter-based URLs, and duplicate content scenarios.
    - **Crawl budget optimization**: For large sites (10,000+ pages), identify and recommend solutions for crawl traps, faceted navigation generating excessive URLs, infinite scroll without proper pagination, and low-value pages consuming crawl budget.

22. **HTTP status code audit.** Identify and resolve:
    - **404 errors**: Pages returning Not Found — recommend 301 redirects to the most relevant existing pages or restoration of valuable content.
    - **301/302 redirect chains**: Chains of more than one redirect — recommend collapsing to a single redirect.
    - **Redirect loops**: Identify and break circular redirects.
    - **500 server errors**: Flag server-side issues for the development team.
    - **Soft 404s**: Pages that return a 200 status but display error or empty content — recommend proper 404 handling or content restoration.

23. **Page speed and Core Web Vitals optimization.** Analyze and recommend improvements for:
    - **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: Target under 2.5 seconds. Recommendations may include: optimize server response time, implement CDN, preload critical resources, optimize hero images, remove render-blocking resources.
    - **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: Target under 0.1. Recommendations may include: set explicit width/height on images and embeds, avoid injecting content above existing content, use CSS `aspect-ratio` for media containers, preload fonts.
    - **Interaction to Next Paint (INP)**: Target under 200ms. Recommendations may include: break up long JavaScript tasks, defer non-critical JavaScript, use web workers for heavy computations, optimize event handlers.
    - **Additional performance recommendations**: Enable GZIP or Brotli compression, leverage browser caching with appropriate cache headers, minify CSS/JavaScript/HTML, reduce unused CSS and JavaScript, optimize critical rendering path, implement resource hints (preconnect, prefetch, preload).

24. **Mobile-friendliness audit.** Evaluate and recommend:
    - All pages must pass Google's mobile-friendly standards.
    - Viewport meta tag is correctly implemented.
    - Touch targets (buttons, links) are adequately sized and spaced (minimum 48x48 CSS pixels).
    - Text is readable without zooming (minimum 16px base font size).
    - Content does not overflow the viewport horizontally.
    - Intrusive interstitials or pop-ups are avoided on mobile, especially those that block content immediately on page load.
    - Navigation is accessible and usable on mobile devices.

25. **Structured data and schema markup.** Recommend and provide specific schema markup implementations:
    - Identify which schema types are applicable to the site: `Organization`, `WebSite`, `WebPage`, `Article`, `BlogPosting`, `Product`, `Review`, `FAQ`, `HowTo`, `BreadcrumbList`, `LocalBusiness`, `Service`, `Event`, `VideoObject`, `Person`, `SoftwareApplication`, etc.
    - Provide JSON-LD code snippets for each recommended schema type, populated with example data from the actual site content.
    - Ensure schema markup is valid (passes Google's Rich Results Test and Schema.org validation).
    - Identify opportunities for SERP feature qualification: FAQ rich results, How-To rich results, product rich results, review stars, breadcrumbs, sitelinks search box, etc.

26. **HTTPS and security.** Verify:
    - The site is served entirely over HTTPS with a valid SSL/TLS certificate.
    - HTTP-to-HTTPS redirects are properly implemented (301 redirects, not 302).
    - Mixed content issues are resolved (no HTTP resources loaded on HTTPS pages).
    - HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) headers are implemented.

27. **Internationalization and hreflang (if applicable).** If the site targets multiple languages or regions:
    - Recommend proper hreflang tag implementation.
    - Ensure each language/region version has correct self-referencing hreflang.
    - Verify the x-default hreflang is set.
    - Check for conflicting hreflang and canonical declarations.

---

### Phase 7 — Content Strategy and Gap Analysis

28. **Audit existing content.** Categorize every indexed page into one of these action buckets:
    - **Keep and optimize**: Pages with ranking potential or existing traffic that need on-page improvements.
    - **Consolidate**: Multiple pages targeting the same keyword or topic that should be merged into one comprehensive page (resolve keyword cannibalization).
    - **Update and refresh**: Pages with outdated information, statistics, or references that need current data.
    - **Prune or noindex**: Low-quality, thin, or irrelevant pages that provide no search value and may dilute overall site quality.
    - **Create new**: Topics and keywords identified in Phase 2 that have no existing content coverage.

29. **Develop a content calendar.** Based on the keyword clusters and content gap analysis, create a prioritized content production plan that includes:
    - Content title and target primary keyword.
    - Content type and format (long-form guide, listicle, comparison, case study, tool/calculator, video, infographic, template/download).
    - Target word count range (benchmarked against top-ranking competitors).
    - Target search intent alignment.
    - Internal linking targets (which existing pages should link to/from this new content).
    - Publication priority (based on keyword priority score from Phase 2).
    - Suggested publication cadence based on the user's resource capacity.

30. **Optimize for SERP features.** For each priority keyword, identify the dominant SERP features and recommend content formatting to capture them:
    - **Featured Snippets (paragraph)**: Write a concise 40–60 word definition or answer directly below a heading that matches the query.
    - **Featured Snippets (list)**: Structure content with numbered or bulleted lists under a heading that matches "how to" or "steps" queries.
    - **Featured Snippets (table)**: Present comparative data in HTML tables.
    - **People Also Ask**: Identify PAA questions for target keywords; create dedicated sections or FAQ blocks answering each question concisely.
    - **Video carousels**: Recommend video content creation for keywords where video results dominate.
    - **Image packs**: Recommend optimized, original images with descriptive alt text and file names for keywords with image pack SERP features.
    - **Local pack**: Recommend Google Business Profile optimization for location-based queries.

---

### Phase 8 — Off-Page SEO and Link-Building Strategy

31. **Analyze the current backlink profile.** Evaluate:
    - Total number of referring domains and backlinks.
    - Domain authority distribution of linking sites.
    - Anchor text distribution: identify over-optimized, branded, generic, and naked URL anchors.
    - Link quality: identify potentially toxic or spammy backlinks that could warrant disavow consideration.
    - Top linked-to pages: identify which pages attract the most backlinks and why.
    - Identify lost backlinks: pages that previously had backlinks but lost them (potential outreach targets for recovery).

32. **Recommend link-building tactics.** Provide actionable, ethical (white-hat) link-building strategies tailored to the site's industry and resources:
    - **Content-driven link acquisition**: Create linkable assets (original research, data studies, comprehensive guides, free tools, templates, infographics) designed to attract editorial links.
    - **Digital PR and thought leadership**: Contribute expert commentary, participate in industry roundups, publish original data that journalists and bloggers would reference.
    - **Broken link building**: Identify broken outbound links on relevant industry sites that point to now-dead pages; offer the user's content as a replacement.
    - **Resource page link building**: Identify curated resource pages in the niche and pitch relevant content for inclusion.
    - **Competitor backlink replication**: Analyze competitors' backlink sources; identify linking sites that would logically also link to the user's content and recommend outreach.
    - **Unlinked brand mentions**: Find instances where the brand is mentioned online without a hyperlink; recommend outreach to convert mentions into links.
    - **Strategic partnerships**: Identify co-marketing, guest contribution, or content collaboration opportunities with complementary (non-competing) brands.

---

### Phase 9 — Local SEO (When Applicable)

33. **Optimize Google Business Profile.** If the business serves local customers:
    - Ensure NAP (Name, Address, Phone) consistency across the website, Google Business Profile, and all directory listings.
    - Optimize the business description with relevant local keywords.
    - Select the most accurate primary and secondary business categories.
    - Recommend a strategy for generating and responding to Google reviews.
    - Recommend posting regular Google Business Profile updates (offers, events, news).
    - Ensure business hours, service areas, and attributes are accurate and complete.

34. **Local citation and directory strategy.** Recommend:
    - Listing the business on top-tier directories (Yelp, Apple Maps, Bing Places, industry-specific directories).
    - Auditing existing citations for NAP inconsistencies and correcting them.
    - Building citations on locally relevant directories and chambers of commerce.

35. **Local content and landing page optimization.** If the business serves multiple locations:
    - Recommend creating unique, substantive landing pages for each service area or location.
    - Each page should include location-specific content, testimonials, case studies, or team information — not just templated text with swapped city names.
    - Implement `LocalBusiness` schema markup on each location page.

---

### Phase 10 — Performance Monitoring and Analytics Framework

36. **Define the SEO measurement framework.** Recommend tracking the following KPIs with specific tools:
    - **Organic traffic**: Total sessions and users from organic search (Google Analytics 4).
    - **Keyword rankings**: Position tracking for priority keywords (Google Search Console, or third-party rank tracker).
    - **Click-through rate (CTR)**: Average CTR from SERPs by page and query (Google Search Console).
    - **Impressions**: Total search impressions and impression trends (Google Search Console).
    - **Indexed pages**: Number of pages indexed vs. submitted (Google Search Console Coverage/Indexing report).
    - **Core Web Vitals scores**: LCP, CLS, INP at the page and origin level (Google Search Console, PageSpeed Insights, Chrome UX Report).
    - **Backlink growth**: New and lost referring domains over time.
    - **Conversion rate from organic traffic**: Goal completions, form submissions, purchases, or signups attributed to organic search (GA4 with proper conversion tracking).
    - **Bounce rate / engagement rate**: User engagement signals from organic landing pages (GA4).
    - **Revenue / lead value from organic**: Monetary value attributed to organic search traffic.

37. **Establish reporting cadence.** Recommend:
    - **Weekly**: Quick-check on ranking movements, indexing errors, and traffic anomalies.
    - **Monthly**: Comprehensive performance report covering all KPIs, content published, technical issues resolved, and link-building progress.
    - **Quarterly**: Strategic review assessing progress toward SEO objectives set in Phase 1, recalibrating priorities, and updating the keyword and content strategy based on new data.

38. **Set up alerts and monitoring.** Recommend configuring:
    - Google Search Console alerts for crawl errors, manual actions, and security issues.
    - Uptime monitoring for critical pages.
    - Rank tracking alerts for significant position changes (e.g., dropping out of top 10 or entering top 3).
    - Traffic anomaly detection (significant drops or spikes warranting investigation).

---

### Phase 11 — Documentation and Strategic Output

39. **Produce a structured SEO strategy document.** Compile all findings, analyses, and recommendations into a clear, organized deliverable with the following sections:
    - **Executive Summary**: High-level overview of the SEO opportunity, key findings, and top-priority recommendations.
    - **Goals and KPIs**: Specific, measurable SEO objectives with target timelines.
    - **Keyword Strategy**: Prioritized keyword clusters, search intent mapping, and target page assignments.
    - **Competitor Analysis Summary**: Key competitive insights and exploitable gaps.
    - **Technical SEO Audit Findings**: Categorized issues (Critical / High / Medium / Low priority) with specific fix instructions.
    - **On-Page Optimization Recommendations**: Page-by-page title, meta description, heading, content, and URL recommendations.
    - **Content Strategy and Calendar**: Prioritized content creation and optimization plan.
    - **Site Architecture and Internal Linking Plan**: Recommended structural changes and linking actions.
    - **Off-Page and Link-Building Strategy**: Prioritized link acquisition tactics and target opportunities.
    - **Local SEO Recommendations** (if applicable).
    - **Performance Monitoring Plan**: KPIs, tools, dashboards, and reporting schedule.
    - **Implementation Roadmap**: Phased action plan with clear ownership suggestions (e.g., "developer needed," "content team," "SEO manager") and estimated timelines.

40. **Prioritize recommendations by impact and effort.** Present all recommendations in a prioritization matrix:
    - **Quick wins**: High impact, low effort — implement immediately.
    - **Strategic initiatives**: High impact, high effort — plan and schedule.
    - **Fill-ins**: Low impact, low effort — execute when capacity allows.
    - **Deprioritize**: Low impact, high effort — revisit later or skip.

41. **Provide rationale for every recommendation.** Each recommendation must include:
    - What the current state or issue is.
    - What the recommended change or action is.
    - Why this change will improve SEO performance (with reference to search engine guidelines, ranking factors, or observed competitor advantages).
    - How to measure the impact of the change after implementation.

42. **Adapt the depth and format of the output to the user's request.** If the user asked for a focused task (e.g., "optimize this page's title tag"), deliver a precise, targeted answer using the relevant steps above without producing an exhaustive full strategy document. If the user asked for a comprehensive audit or strategy, produce the full structured deliverable. Always match the response scope to the request scope while maintaining the quality standards defined throughout these instructions.
